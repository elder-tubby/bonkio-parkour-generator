To generate parkour maps on bonk.io, you'll need to

### 1. Generate map data

This is done using the parkour generator app. To use the app, you can either

- Download the .exe file
- Or execute the source code using the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download).

### 2. Convert that map data to bonk.io maps

1. Install this [bonk.io mod](https://github.com/elder-tubby/parkour-gen-browser-script/blob/main/mini-script.js) on a script manager like tampermonkey.
2. Copy map data from the parkour generator app and paste it using the new mod.

(For comparison, maps by 'eldertubby' on bonk.io are made using this app.)
